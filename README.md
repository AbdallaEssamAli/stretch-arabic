Arabic calligraphy JavaScript library (client-side and server-side)

As an example, the Arabic name for Australia is commonly written
أستراليا
In a world map that I bought in Morocco, it looks like this - the س and ي are made super-long:

What's going on? Well, as long as the Arabic word's baseline is consistent, the word can be as long
or short as you want, and calligraphy is awesome. But there isn't a font that can standardize all of that.

It needs to be a custom JavaScript library / configuration.

## Client-side tool

Try it out: <a href="http://mapmeld.com/stretch-arabic/">http://mapmeld.com/stretch-arabic/</a>

## Server-side library

To be determined... would require node-canvas support, which has several native dependencies.
Look up how to install node-canvas on Heroku or other cloud platforms.
